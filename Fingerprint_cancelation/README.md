# cancelable-fingerprint
A revocable fingerprint template generation using cartesian transformation to prevent privacy and security concerns. The system does fingerprint matching on the transformed templates, and is able to recover the original hash of the fingerprint template by using reed-solomon error correction mechanism.
fvs2.py contains the main function and in preprocessing preprocess is the main file.
